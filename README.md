# Zenoh Performance Tests

This is a repository that contains the codes to test the performance of [Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/).  
Currently (2021/12/21), the Zenoh version tested is 0.5.0-beta9.

We use [psrecord](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord) to record the CPU and memory usage of the test program.

## Build

To build the program, please make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed.

Run the following command to build release version:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

If you need to parse the log file generated by [psrecord](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord), please build the `usage-parser` crate with the following command:
```bash
cd usage-parser
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Make sure you have build all the programs.

To run the test, simply run:
```bash
./target/release/zenoh_performance_test
```

To parse the log file generated by [psrecord](https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord), run:
```bash
./target/release/usage-parser -i <path to log file>
```

## Development

For people who are running experiment testings with this program. You may store the psrecord generated files under the `experiment-results` folder which is ignored in `.gitignore` file.
