## Settings

In this benchmark, each task takes a buffer from the pool, fills it with random numbers and gives it back to the pool. We measure the total elapsed time to consume all tasks.

The following sites are measured.

- `pool`: Zenoh's ObjectBufferPool
- `arena`: Jerry's implementation of lock-free concurrent buffer pool.
- `std`: Use standard library's default allocator

This is our settings.

- async-std runtime 1.10.0
- 32 concurrent workers (on 32-core system)
- Pool initialization time is separatedly measured

## Zenoh's object buffer pool vs. std

10^6 tasks, 65536 bytes per buffer
